# Michael Scott Clicky Game

Click on images to earn points, but don't click on any more than once!

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Assignment Parameters

1. Check out the [example solution](https://clicky-game.netlify.com/) and study the app's basic functionality.

2. Create a new React application using [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

3. The application should render different images (of your choice) to the screen. Each image should listen for click events.

4. The application should keep track of the user's score. The user's score should be incremented when clicking an image for the first time. The user's score should be reset to 0 if they click the same image more than once.

5. Every time an image is clicked, the images rendered to the page should shuffle themselves in a random order.

6. Once the user's score is reset after an incorrect guess, the game should restart.

7. When complete, the application should be deployed to Github Pages.

## Getting started

Click on an image to start the game. You win when you've clicked all 12 images without clicking on any more than once.
